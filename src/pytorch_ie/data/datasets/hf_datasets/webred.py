_DESCRIPTION = """\
A dataset for extracting relationships from a variety of text found on the World Wide Web. Text
on the web has diverse surface forms including writing styles, complexity and grammar. This dataset collects
sentences from a variety of webpages and documents that represent a variety of those categories. In each sentence,
there will be a subject and object entities tagged with subject SUBJ{...} and object OBJ{...}, respectively. The two
entities are either related by a relation from a set of pre-defined ones or has no relation.

More information about the dataset can be found in our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09681
